*Pawn2Queen* is a personal project that combines my passion for chess with Machine Learning. It leverages Transformer architectures, Reinforcement Learning and Knowledge Distillation to develop a chess AI.\
The name reflects the journey of a humble pawn becoming a queen in chess. It also symbolizes my learning process to master state-of-the-art AI techniques.

## üöÄ Project goals
The project is focused on creating a chess AI using modern techniques while serving as a space for personal growth in fields such as:
- **Transformer architectures**: GPT-style models for chess positions or move generation
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training an agent to play chess through self-play and fine-tuning with RLHF
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Compressing large, complex models into smaller, efficient ones

Although primarily an educational project, my goal is to eventually **deploy the bot on Lichess**, where it can play against real opponents.\
By doing so, I hope to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model, which can be used to further improve it through additional training and fine-tuning (and learning for me!).


## üöß Project status

This project is a **work in progress**.
For a detailed history of changes, refer to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This project uses Python and is managed with `pyproject.toml`. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jacoporepossi/Pawn2Queen.git
   cd Pawn2Queen
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    If you plan to develop or contribute, install the package in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. Set up the configuration file to use Stockfish as the chess engine:
    - Download the Stockfish binary from the [official website](https://stockfishchess.org/download/).
    - Rename `config.template.yaml` to `config.yaml`
    - Update the `config.yaml` file in the root directory with the path to the Stockfish binary. For example:
    ```yaml
    stockfish_path: "C:/path/to/stockfish.exe"
    ```

## ‚ú® Features

- **Play Against AI**: Play chess against a Transformer-powered AI or Stockfish
- **Customizable Levels**: Adjust the AI's skill level using Stockfish's UCI options
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate custom models against Stockfish at various levels
- **Training Framework**: Scripts for training and fine-tuning models using Reinforcement Learning

## üìä Evaluation

The project includes an evaluation pipeline to test the AI against Stockfish at different levels. Use the following command to evaluate a model:

```bash
python src/evaluate/evaluate.py --levels 1 2 3 --rounds 50 --model_name RandomChessBot
```

- `--levels`: Stockfish levels to evaluate against (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
- `--rounds`: Number of games to play per level and color
- `--model_name`: Name of the model to evaluate

## üß† Models

Here are the models currently implemented in the project and their match statistics against Stockfish at different levels. The evaluation was performed using 500 games for each color, for a total of 1000 games per level.
The statistics, taken from [this reference](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Match_Statistics), are as follows:
- **Wins**: Number of games won by the model, $w$
- **Losses**: Number of games lost by the model, $l$
- **Draws**: Number of games drawn by the model, $d$
- **Win Ratio**: Ratio of wins to total games played, calculated as $(w + \frac{d}{2})/n$, where $n$ is the total number of games played
- **Draw Ratio**: Ratio of draws to total games played
- **Likelihood of Superiority (LOS)**: Calculated using the formula $0.5*[1 + erf((w - l)/‚àö(w + 2l))]$, it refers to the statistical chance that one player (or engine) has a higher probability of winning against another, based on their rating difference or match results


**RandomChessBot**: a simple bot that makes random moves. It serves as initial baseline for testing.

**NeuralChessBot** a simple neural network-based bot that uses a feedforward neural network to evaluate positions and select moves (coming soon).\
**TransformerBot**: a transformer-based bot that uses a transformer architecture to evaluate positions and select moves (coming soon).

## üß™ Playground

It is possible to play against the AI using the `play_vs_computer.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks/` directory, allowing you to either select the trained models or Stockfish as the opponent.
