*Pawn2Queen* is a personal project that combines my passion for chess with Machine Learning. It leverages Transformer architectures, Reinforcement Learning and Knowledge Distillation to develop a chess AI.\
The name reflects the journey of a humble pawn becoming a queen in chess. It also symbolizes my learning process to master state-of-the-art AI techniques.

### Project goals
The project is focused on creating a chess AI using modern techniques while serving as a space for personal growth in fields such as:
- Transformer Architectures (like GPT-style models for chess positions or move generation)
- Reinforcement Learning (both training an agent to play chess through self-play and RLHL for fine-tuning an LLM)
- Knowledge Distillation (compressing large complex models into smaller efficient ones)

Although primarily an educational project, my goal is to eventually **deploy the bot on Lichess**, where it can play against real opponents.\
By doing so, I hope to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model, which can be used to further improve it through additional training and fine-tuning (and learning for me!).
